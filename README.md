# xlab

**xlab** is a speculative lab for frontier ideas — a growing collection of white papers, protocols, and design visions that explore the edges of technology, AI, and the future web.

### **We focus on foundational questions that shape what's next**  

This is not a codebase. It's an evolving canvas of questions, frameworks, and provocations — built for open discussion, remixing, and exploration.
